- 👋 Hi, I’m Pashav. I turned 50 this year and I'm looking to achieve one of my dreams when I started college back in 1988, to focus on building & programming Robots. Life just put me in a different path 
     and I'm going to go back to one of my passions since I was a kid.
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics, AI & Robots programming, I'm new to this field(like a blank canvas) and very excited to start.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics with Arduino micro controllers.
- 💞️ I’m also new to GitHub, so I need to learn how to use it.
